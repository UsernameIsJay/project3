				<span>Rain doesn’t have to mean the end of a beautiful day. In fact, the first falling drops can signify the beginning of something even more beautiful – here are seven great reasons why rain is actually a beneficial, positive force.</span>
				<br/><br/>
				1. Rain makes things grow. Nature, nurture, and water go hand in hand.
				<br/><br/>
				2. Rain inspires creativity. Think of a “brainstorm” – great ideas often come during a downpour.
				<br/><br/>
				3. Rain encourages fun. Life wouldn’t be the same without puddles to splash in.
				<br/><br/>
				4. Rain brings us together. A storm is the perfect chance to get close with someone special.
				<br/><br/>
				5. Rain awakens us. Nature reminds us how strange and beautiful our planet is.
				<br/><br/>
				6. Rain teaches us how to dance. And when the sun returns, we’ll be better dancers than ever.
				<br/><br/>
				7. Rain brings rainbows. In the end we see that the ultimate purpose of life is color and beauty.
				<br/><br/>
				<span>The next time it rains, step outside and try to use all five senses to experience it: see it, hear it, taste it, smell it, and feel it falling on your skin. No one else can experience it for you!</span>
